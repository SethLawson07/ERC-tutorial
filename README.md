This tutorial implements smart contracts based on the ERC20 and ERC721 standards
I explain these standards

ERC20 and ERC721 are two smart contract standards developed on the Ethereum blockchain. They define the minimum functions that smart contracts must implement to be considered as ERC20 or ERC721 tokens.

>ERC20: This is a standard for tokens developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines the minimum functions that smart contracts must implement to be considered ERC20 tokens. ERC20 tokens can be used to represent digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, real estate or stocks.

>ERC721: This is a standard for non-fungible tokens developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines the minimum functions that smart contracts must implement to be considered ERC721 tokens. ERC721 tokens are unique and cannot be duplicated or split. They can be used to represent virtual objects such as video game characters, digital artworks, etc.

>These two standards ERC20 and ERC721 are widely used on the Ethereum blockchain, and many cryptocurrency and gaming projects use these standards to develop their tokens.
